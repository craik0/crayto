            Hello, I hope you all have had a good March so far; life is going well, although I have been struggling to stay focused on school and work.  
            As for my YouTube, 3 projects are in the works.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Mario & Luigi: Brothership</strong> should be ending within the coming month, and I have been working on a <strong>Playboi Carti</strong> video, which I finally got to drop and is doing very well, which I'm happy to see.  
            A <strong>Mother 3</strong> video essay is being worked on, but it is in the very early stages, so don't expect it anytime soon.  
            However, a series that you can see soon is the <strong>GANTZ recap series</strong>, in which I go through the GANTZ manga one arc at a time, talking about its story and giving commentary.  
            That should start coming out in February.
        </p>

        <p>
            And finally, on the <strong>Let’s Play</strong> side of things, I am deciding between bringing back **RL Craft** or **Persona 5X**.  
            I don't know which one will be better since RL Craft will take a long time, and Persona 5X is not officially in English.  
            That’s all for this month; see y’all in April.
        </p>
