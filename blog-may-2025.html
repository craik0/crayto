            <p>Hello yall, i hope you guys are doing good its been a while so this one gonna be a lot of info so be perpared. I have decided to (more or less) move away from lets plays, this is becasue due to the alogrithim i had to cut out so much that it was not worth it. But do not fear I am replacing lets play videos with Wednesday streams. Every wednesday from 6-9 I will be streaming, it could be a game that im playing starting or Want to show you guys the first example of. But as for videos i will be going fully into short video essays. The Psycho Patrol R did great and I have medium hopes for the Scedule 1 video. This was something I thought A lot about and i think it will be the best for me and my schooling and youtube. Now thats over with here are some things that are happening, I am working on the website again after leaving it behind it will start to be promoted in my videos, I have three videos in production that im writing that I think you will enjoy. I got a little addicted to twitter (I will never call it X) i tweet once every day so go follow to hear more of my bad opionons. Will thats it for this month expect a blog post the 15 of every month and make it a great one!</p>
