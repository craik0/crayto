            <p>Sure, here’s your message with corrected grammar and no formatting:

Hello y’all, I hope you’re all doing well—it’s been a while, so this one’s going to be packed with updates, so be prepared. I’ve decided to (more or less) move away from lets plays. The reason is mainly the algorithm—it forced me to cut out so much content that it just wasn’t worth it anymore. But don’t worry: I’m replacing lets play videos with Wednesday streams. Every Friday Evening, I’ll be live streaming. It could be a game I’m currently playing, just starting, or something cool I want to show you guys for the first time. As for videos, I’m shifting fully into short video essays. Psycho Patrol R did great, and I have medium-high hopes for the Schedule 1 video. This is a change I’ve thought a lot about, and I believe it’s what’s best for both my YouTube and my school schedule. Now that’s out of the way, here’s what else is happening: I’m working on the website again after setting it aside for a bit. It’ll start being promoted in my videos soon. I have three videos in production right now that I’m writing, and I think you’ll really enjoy them. I got a little addicted to Twitter (I will never call it X). I tweet daily, so follow me there if you want more of my bad opinions. That’s it for this month. Expect a blog post on the 15th of every month, and as always—make it a great one!</p>
